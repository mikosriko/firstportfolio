                As you can read from the home page and the name of the website, my name is Mikolaj Rutyna.
                <br>
                I was born in Poland and raised in the UK for most of my life. Over the years, I have developed an interest in the technical and the creative world. I have a deep passion for video games since childhood, which still resides within me to this day. Not only it fuels my dopamine, but I also gain new ideas and inspiration which is how I mainly ended up here.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class = "about-headings">So what kind of interests and skills have I developed from “video games”?</span> <br>
                • Game development in Roblox (formerly) and Unity. <br>
                • Front-end web development. <br>
                • Traditional Art: <br>
                ▸ Landscapes and portraits involving media such as pencils, soft pastels and watercolouring. <br>
                • Digital Art: <br>
                ▸ UI design - for websites and games. <br>
                ▸ Pixel art - for games. <br>
                ▸ GFX (Graphic Effects in Blender) <br>
                ▸ Graphic Design - mainly for videos. <br>
                • Video editing: <br>
                ▸ Stylised editing in a music video fashion. <br>
                ▸ Trailers
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class = "about-headings">Roblox? Really?</span> <br>
                Yup. When I learned to code for the first time with Python at school, I used my knowledge on Roblox which has a built in engine using Lua. Because of Roblox was how I was easily able to transition to Unity due to the same principles in both engines.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class = "about-headings">What did I do worthwhile?</span> <br>
                I took my interest further into Goldsmiths University, which was where I have produced more independent work and able to graduate as a Creative Computerist.
                <br>
                Using my previous work that I am proud of, including my degree, I ended up working my way up the career ladder over the years, which is where I am now. Pretty cool story, eh?
