        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?</p>
        <p>I have listed all of the skills and qualities beforehand that I am proud to show off onto the website to show to everyone. This allowed me to build a foundation of how I will start making wire-frames for the website and the type of design I want to go for that represents me. The website will mention the types of creative/technical jobs I can do, including the skills needed and hobbies I do which helps me improve on these jobs. When people will look at my website, they will see a laid-back guy that loves to do things he enjoys which is shown in the work.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Who is your audience?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have used this website "https://www.awwwards.com/" to look at examples of high-quality portfolios to see exactly what information people would except to receive a portfolio website. This allowed me to give me an idea on how I should create my website and what I should exactly mention.</li>
          <li>I have slightly looked into how to make portfolios, mainly gathering information such as presenting the best work that you are proud of that would attract anyone who visits your website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resource on portfolio creation</p>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The first thing I planned was the colour scheme that not only suits my style and it's pleasing to look at, but it also allows contents to stand out from each other. I have went with a red, very dark blue, white and black combo.</li>
          <li>All of the content are quite large, which can be easy to look at from any distance and understand all of the information on the screen.</li>
          <li>Then I planned the sitemap for my website to have a basic idea of how people will navigate.</li>
          <li>I created two different types of wire-frames. I started with the low wire-frame including 4 pages (home, about, work and contact). I am making the website as simple as possible giving information to the reader as efficiently as possible while being satisfied with my work. The low fidelity wire-frame allows me to build upon it to become a high fidelity wire-frame.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p>
        <p>In the wire-frames, there is a navigation bar at the top that easily shows all of the pages available to visit. There are also other navigations, especially when scrolling down the home page which also leads to every other page on the website (the large white containers).</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Learning</p>
        <li>I have used websites such as w3schools and searching through stackoverflow for certain queries that allowed me to properly use flex and able to fit the whole website on all screen devices. I learned to crop images so they are able to fit in certain containers.</li>
        <p>Libraries and other resources</p>
        <li>I have mainly used Bootstrap to not only take some of the examples and modify them for my own use, but allowed me to properly fit everything onto a page using flex and other things. I learned a lot looking through the examples and the information provided in the website to create the website I envisioned.</li>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What worked well</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>All of the pages function as intended.</li>
              <li>The gifs and images load as intended, showing all my work and myself.</li>
              <li>Learning how to use flex and other things from Bootstrap allowed me to make an even better website than I used to before. It is able to fit on all devices</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>What might be improved</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Even though I learned how to use flex, I still don't know how to use it to its maximum potential. I still struggled to align many content but I eventually was able to get them to fit and align on the page on all devices after a while.</li>
              <li>Could have added any content using JavaScript on my own instead of just taking things from Bootstrap.</li>
              <li>About flex, the top navbar isn't as aligned as I wanted to, which I would need to learn how to use flex properly in the future to get the navbar I want.</li>
              <li>At one point, I could add extra pages going into individual works of mine.</li>
          </ul>
